Unfortunately, our team did not manage to complete all of the tasks assigned for this sprint.
This is because the tasks we had assigned required much more time than anticipated. There were
also additional subtasks that were added to certain user stories i.e TEAM6-14 during the sprint
as there were additional duties that we did not account for. Furthermore, due to the scope of our project
it is only natural that user stories take so much work/can be divided into several components until
a feature is implemented from a user perspective. With this in mind, we will be more diligent in the
allocation and breakdown of user story tasks in the coming sprints.
