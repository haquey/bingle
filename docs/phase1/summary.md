## The Project Objective

The objective of our application is to be an academic platform based around a search engine to be used by UTSC students and instructors. Users can search for key terms found within archived files, community discussion posts, or marketplace listings. The goal is to provide an engaging, community driven, academic platform to search for all kinds of information.

## Key Personas:

Hana Song: Hana is a 19 year old university student who has had experience with applications like Google, Facebook, and Twitter for many years. She is also a novice programmer and is taking beginner level university CS courses.

Colin Jordan: Jordan is a 30-year old computer science professor. Jordan wants his students to be able to easily find all the necessary course material that he has to offer. As a result of heavily valuing student feedback, he often holds office hours throughout the week to answer questions.

## The Key Scenarios:

**Looking for Notes:** Hana did not fully understand some topics presented in lecture so she wishes to view the notes online. She knows that Prof. Colin  uploads his notes to Bingle right after every lecture. She searches for the notes using the course code and the lectures overall topic. She finds the notes and is able to view them and clear her confusion.

**Looking for a Textbook:** Hana needs to buy a textbook for her management class. She doesn't want to buy an overpriced book from the book store so she heads over to Bingle and searches for the textbook. She uses the textbooks name and gets a variety of results ranging from uploaded notes, posts, and marketplace listings. She quickly filters by marketplace and is able to view all the the listings for the textbook she wanted.

**Bad Upload:** Colin is querying Bingle to look at things that students have uploaded, thinking he might be able to answer some questions. While doing so, he finds that one of his students uploaded the answers to the midterm from a few weeks ago. Colin was not happy about this since he made it clear to his students that this information was restricted to his course site. He quickly removes the file that the student uploaded. He then heads over to the discussion board in order to make a post reminding students to be cautious and respectful of what they post. He sets this post as an instructor announcement so he is sure all the users will see it.

## The Key Principles:

**The User is the Master of Their Own Destiny:** We want to give the a robust set of tools to make them feel like they are always in control. When it comes to searching for key info, listing items for sale or participating in online discussions, we want to make sure that the user can filter their experience to cater to their specific needs.

**Uniform Simplicity:** Despite the several features our application might offer, the user should feel at home at all times through a single, uniform and cohesive design. Self-learning should also be easy, given its simplicity. Furthermore, learning to interface with one aspect of the site should let them be familiar with others.
