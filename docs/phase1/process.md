## The Team

## How did we organize the team? Which tools did we use?
* The team was organized through facebook chat. Here we mainly discuss our roles for each phase, and discuss any logistics that come up regarding the project.
* For technical discussion or for specific questions about the code or depencies, we have organized a slack channel for our team as it provides plugins that help stylize code, keep track of Github pushes, easier message searching, and many more.

## How did we make decisions?
* Team decisions such as roles, ideas to use from a brainstorming session, what languages and tools we should use, are usually made in person if they are discussed during the week, or over the facebook chat that we dedicated to logistical discussions.
* For conflicting ideas between team members, we would typically take a vote within the team on which to implement in order to give a fair path moving forward while not wasting time on either further discussion or implementing both solutions

## How did we define priorites/difficulty?
* Prorities in user stories are usually defined as a field in JIRA within the story. So prior to starting a sprint, we review what has the highest priority first before taking it into the sprint. If this isn't done, though the sprint may be successful, we would be jeopardize the success of the whole Epic.
* Story difficulty is defined by Story Points, which is another field in JIRA that's saved within the story. The team sets an estimate as to how many story points they can can get done every sprint. As we progress through the project, our estimates will get more accurate, which will lead to more successful sprints. Story points typically go in fibonacci order (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...) where higher numbers mean higher difficulty.
* Taking into account both story priorities and story size, we can assure a set of successful sprints, and a successful epic.

## Did we meet in person or online?
* We all met in person through lectures and tutorials.

## How often would we meet?
* In person we would typically meet 2-3 times per week, as that is what all our schedules permit.

* To make up for the lack of in-person meet-ups, we would keep both the facebook and slack channels active with updates, questions, concerns, and solution ideas.

## What did we learn this phase that we can use next phase?
* We learned not to move forward on decisions that haven't had the approval from the entire team. We discovered that some of the ideas that were already settled in from the brainstorming phase wasn't run by the entire team, which costed us time to get everyone up to speed in terms of getting the related work done, and in terms of knowledge sharing. Having a consistent knowledge base throughout the project prior to getting said work done will help drive this team's success.
