# Competition Analysis
  
## Competitor: OneClass/CourseHero
  
OneClass and CourseHero are two products that are similar to Bingle in the sense that they provide features to allow students to upload notes/files to share with others.  
  
Bingle aims to differentiate itself from the above platforms by providing users with the opportunity to search through its archive of files without having to create an account or contribute to the platform in any way (i.e. upload your own files). Platforms such as OneClass and CourseHero have higher barriers to entry for students as it requires them to either pay for membership to be able to download files or upload files of their own to be eligible to download more. By eliminating this barrier to entry, we hope to encourage user adoption amongst students as they aren’t required to pay to use our platform.
  
Being that OneClass and CourseHero have the monetization of users as their primary objective, it is clear why their business model requires most users to pay a fee to use most of the features their services provide. If they found an alternative method to monetize users while providing their services for free, we might see them allow users to download files without having to pay a fee. 
With user adoption (and not monetization) being Bingle’s primary goal as a new educational community tool, the distinction in barriers to entry for student users clearly exemplify the priorities the respective platforms hold.
  
## Competitor: Tusbe
  
Tusbe is a website that allows university students to list used textbooks and various educational products for sale.
  
Bingle’s objective is to provide a better marketplace environment for students by catering to a better user experience. The goal is to provide a robust set of features, allowing students to sift through postings according to pre-existing categories, view images of postings and more. Students also have the ability to apply tags to their listings of products so that they are prioritized when other users search for certain keywords. The goal is to provide a more enhanced, visually appealing user experience for students than Tusbe currently accomodates.
  
The reason why Tusbe lacks a robust set of features for viewing and listing items is that it most likely hopes to appeal to its users through its simplistic design. Furthermore, being one of the first book exchange sites serving the GTA (since 1998), its age really shows and perhaps the website hasn’t updated its UX/UI in a fairly long time.
  
By providing a more enhanced and appealing user experience, Bingle hopes to capture more student users looking to post and purchase used textbooks and other educational tools.
  
## Competitor: Reddit (UofT/UTSC Subreddit)
  
The UofT subreddit allows students to ask general questions and participate in online discussions pertaining to academic life.
  
Bingle’s goal is to provide a similar online environment to foster productive discussion between not only students but instructors as well. By producing valuable discussion between students and instructors, users can search for information through these discussion posts that they might not have found within  textbooks, notes or other files. 
  
The reason why instructors generally steer away from third party discussion platforms such as Reddit is because they are not entitled to the same privileges as they would be using more regulated internal software found at UofT. Furthermore, given that Reddit is a third party social media platform for a massive range of users, it has no incentive to create discussion platform more suitable for instructors in specific.
  
By producing a non-hostile, ideal discussion platform for instructors and providing a variety of discussion features, Bingle aims to cultivate a discussion board containing valuable information for users to search through and participate in if they desire.
  
## Conclusion
  
Bingle sets itself apart from its competitors by producing a comprehensive environment that allows users to search for archived files uploaded by other users, query discussion posts and sift through marketplace listings all in one. We hope to provide an infrastructure that will welcome an academic community of students and instructors to develop and thrive while making use of our platform.
